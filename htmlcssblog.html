            <p class="post-content">
                Tracer is hands-down one of the most fun characters to play, mainly because of her high mobility. Her Blink ability lets her teleport short distances, which is amazing for getting in and out of fights quickly. Plus, her Recall ability lets her rewind a few seconds to her previous health and position, which is a lifesaver when I dive too deep into enemy lines. Tracer’s ultimate, Pulse Bomb, is a sticky explosive that does serious damage in a small area – it’s perfect for taking out tanks or clustered enemies. For me, Tracer’s strengths lie in her ability to move around unpredictably and deliver high burst damage, especially against squishy heroes.

            <p class="post-content">
                Genji has always appealed to me for his versatility and ninja-style combat. His Shurikens are great for both long-range poking and close-up attacks. But what really makes him powerful is Deflect, where he can reflect enemy projectiles back at them nothing’s more satisfying than deflecting a powerful enemy ult. His Swift Strike ability is another favorite of mine; it’s a quick dash that damages enemies and resets on elimination, letting me chain kills. Genji’s ultimate, Dragonblade, draws a powerful sword for close-range melee attacks, which can be devastating if used right. I think Genji’s strengths are his agility, damage potential, and ability to counter certain threats effectively.

            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch_gamepedia/images/3/3b/Reinhardt-ow2-portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20191104214011" alt="Reinhardt">
            <p class="post-content">
                I feel like Reinhardt is a must-pick when it comes to holding the line for the team. His massive Barrier Field shield can absorb a lot of incoming damage, protecting teammates and giving us a strong frontline. What I really enjoy, though, is his Charge ability it’s risky but rewarding, as it lets Reinhardt dash forward and pin enemies against walls. His Fire Strike is great for dealing damage from a distance, and his ultimate, Earthshatter, can knock down all enemies in a cone in front of him. I’d say Reinhardt’s strength is in his ability to create space and lead team pushes, while also being able to deal some serious damage up close.
